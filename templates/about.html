            <p>It was dug up by men and women who work and live in the electorates of those who sit opposite.</p>
            <p>It's coal that has ensured for over a hundred years that Australia has enjoyed an energy competitive advantage, that has delivered prosperity to Australian businesses [...]</p>

        <p>After yet another record-breaking summer of heat and drought, the 2019 Australian election was set to be fought on climate change and the environment.</p>
        <p>The environment lost.</p>
        <p>It was Scott Morrison – not the progressive opposition – who would go on to preside over the most devastating bushfires the country has ever seen.</p>
        <p>The Black Summer destroyed 3,000 homes, killed 800 million animals and choked the country in smoke for months.</p>

        <p>For many Australians, coal is a job and a livelihood. It's the country's second largest export after iron ore.</p>
        <p>Shortly after their election victory the government finally approved plans for a new Adani mine, after years of environmental hold-ups and activist protest. It's set to be one of Australia's biggest.</p>
        <p>The cruel irony is that working people are the ones who will suffer most in the coming century from extreme weather and water scarcity.</p>

        <p>It's easy to forget that much of the prosperity we enjoy is powered by billions of tonnes of fossilised material dug out of the ground.</p>
        <p>We don't encounter it in our day-to-day lives when we flick a switch or boil a kettle.</p>
        <p>This project started as an act of curiosity: opening a map to see where this stuff comes from, what it looks like.</p>
        <p>Assembled here are satellite images of 115 operational coal mines in Australia.</p>
        <p>I was inspired to present the data in this format by Josh Begley's Prison Map. Also striking are Mishka Henner's images of cattle feedlots.</p>
